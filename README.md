# Descriptive-Analytics
Descriptive analytics uses data mining to identify patterns and trends within large datasets, providing insights into past events without making predictions about the future. It focuses on what's in the data not on why it is in the data. The correlations or patterns that data mining uncovers may have little to do with causality, or provide an understanding of why variables that are correlated move together.
