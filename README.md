<h2>Descriptive Analytics Overview</h2>

<p><strong>Descriptive analytics</strong> primarily focuses on summarizing, understanding past data, and finding trends and patterns that exist in the dataset by using techniques like data aggregation and data mining (also known as data discovery).</p>

<p>Descriptive analytics provides insights into past events without making predictions about the future. It focuses on what's in the data, not on why it is in the data. The correlations or patterns that data mining uncovers may have little to do with causality, or provide an understanding of why variables that are correlated move together.</p>

<p>Descriptive analytics can serve as a source of ideas.</p>

<p>Another tool used in descriptive analytics is simulation. It focuses on providing a detailed picture of the inner workings of a system by representing and understanding the behavior of existing or proposed systems. This is done by generating data that depicts how a system would behave under different conditions. However, it does not make predictions about the future<a href="[https://www.example.com](https://studyonline.unsw.edu.au/blog/descriptive-predictive-prescriptive-analytics)" target="_blank">[reference]</a>.</p>
